# Queue-shop-simulation

In this project an user can see a simulation of a shop activity with 3 queues (there are 12 clients and 60 seconds of simulation).
He can type the minimum and the maximum arrival time (it means when a client will reach the shop)
He can type a minimum and a maximum service time (the amount of time spent by each client to buy from a seller).

The app will show the evolution of the queues, the waiting, service and empty time for every queue in every second.
We can see the average and service time for every queue when the simulation ends.
